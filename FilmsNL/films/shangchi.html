                    <p>Thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu discovers the mystical ten rings which grant immortality and
                        godly powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organization, conquering kingdoms and toppling
                        governments throughout history. In 1996, Wenwu searches for Ta Lo, a village said to harbor
                        mythical beasts. He travels through a magical forest to the village entrance but is stopped by
                        guardian Ying Li. The two fall in love, and Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="collapse" id="long">
                    <p>When the villagers reject Wenwu, Li chooses to leave with him and they have two children,
                        Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is 7, Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang.
                        Wenwu massacres the Iron Gang and resumes leadership of his organization. He makes Shang-Chi
                        undergo brutal training in martial arts, but does not allow Xialing to train so she teaches
                        herself in secret. When Shang-Chi is 14, Wenwu sends him to assassinate the Iron Gang's leader.
                        After fulfilling his mission, a demoralized Shang-Chi runs away to San Francisco and adopts the
                        name "Shaun".
                        <br>
                        In the present day, Shang-Chi works as a valet with his best friend Katy, who does not know
                        about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, who steal a pendant that Li gave to
                        Shang-Chi. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of Xialing and, fearing that
                        the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from Li, Shang-Chi decides to meet her.
                        He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing at an underground
                        fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight
                        club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant.
                        <br>
                        They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map
                        leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she has been
                        held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release
                        her. When his children and Katy object, he imprisons them. The three meet former actor Trevor
                        Slattery, whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu,[N 1] and his hundun companion
                        Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo.
                        <br>
                        The group escapes and goes to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese
                        mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan, Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo:
                        thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and
                        its minions, but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the
                        Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing
                        Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy
                        join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons
                        crafted from dragon scales.
                        <br>
                        Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the
                        nearby lake, then attacks the Gate with the rings. This allows some of the Dweller's minions to
                        escape, and the Ten Rings join forces with the villagers to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by
                        the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once
                        more and Shang-Chi gains the upper hand, but chooses to spare Wenwu. The Dweller-in-Darkness
                        escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves Shang-Chi, bequeathing him the
                        rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing,
                        and Katy battle and kill the Dweller-in-Darkness. Afterwards, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San
                        Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong to the Sanctum Sanctorum.
                        <br>
                        In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers.
                        They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene,
                        Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to
                        disband the organization.
