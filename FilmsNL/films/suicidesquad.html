                    <p>Intelligence officer Amanda Waller assembles two Task Force X teams—colloquially known as the
                        Suicide Squad—that comprise Belle Reve penitentiary inmates, who agree to carry out missions for
                        Waller in exchange for lighter sentences. They are sent to the South American island nation of
                        Corto Maltese after its government is overthrown by an anti-American regime, and are tasked with
                        destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim which holds a secretive experiment known as
                        "Project Starfish".</p>
                </div>
                <div class="collapse" id="long">
                    <p>One team is led by Waller's subordinate Colonel Rick Flag and is almost entirely wiped out by the
                        Corto Maltese military upon landing. This distraction allows the other team to enter the country
                        undetected. The second team is led by assassin Bloodsport, who accepted the mission in order to
                        prevent his daughter from being incarcerated at Belle Reve, and consists of Peacemaker, King
                        Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2. They find Flag at a base camp for rebel soldiers and
                        convince rebellion leader Sol Soria to assist them.
                        <br>
                        Harley Quinn survives the attack on the first team and is taken captive by the Corto Maltese
                        government. She learns of the new regime's plans to use Project Starfish against other nations.
                        In the Corto Maltese capital, the second team captures the Thinker, the lead scientist in charge
                        of Project Starfish. Harley escapes and joins the others, who use the Thinker to break into
                        Jötunheim. Most of the Squad rigs the facility with explosives as Flag and Ratcatcher 2 enter
                        the underground laboratory with the Thinker. He reveals that Project Starfish is Starro the
                        Conqueror, a giant alien starfish that creates smaller versions of itself to kill people and
                        take control of their bodies. 
                        <br>
                        Starro was brought to Earth by the U.S. government, who have been
                        secretly funding experiments on him in Corto Maltese for the past thirty years using thousands
                        of the island's citizens as test subjects. An enraged Flag decides to leak a hard drive
                        containing evidence of this revelation but is killed by Peacemaker who is under secret orders
                        from Waller to cover up the U.S.'s involvement in the experiments. Meanwhile, a skirmish between
                        the Squad and the Corto Maltese military leads to Polka-Dot Man accidentally setting off the
                        explosives prematurely. As the facility falls apart, Peacemaker attempts to execute Ratcatcher 2
                        for knowing the truth about Starro, but Bloodsport shoots him and takes the drive.
                        <br>
                        Starro escapes the destroyed laboratory, kills the Thinker and much of the military, and begins
                        taking control of the island's population. Waller tells the Squad that their mission is complete
                        now that Jötunheim is destroyed, but Bloodsport chooses to ignore her and leads his teammates in
                        battling Starro, while Waller is knocked out by her subordinates to prevent her from executing
                        the squad. During the battle, Polka-Dot Man is killed, Harley pierces a hole in Starro's eye,
                        and Ratcatcher 2 summons the city's rats to chew the alien to death from the inside. With the
                        military diverted, Soria takes control of the government and pledges democratic elections.
                        Bloodsport forces Waller to release him and his surviving teammates from their imprisonment in
                        exchange for keeping the contents of the drive confidential, and the Squad is airlifted out of
                        Corto Maltese.

                        In a post-credits scene, Peacemaker is shown to be alive and under the supervision of Waller's
                        subordinates.
