                        conquistadors die, the Puka Michuna tribe heals the survivors with the Tree's flowers. The
                        tribal chief refuses to reveal the Tree's location, so Aguirre stabs him and burns the village.
                        The dying chief curses the conquistadors, making them immortal and unable to leave sight of the

                    <p>
                        In 1916 London, Dr. Lily Houghton's Tears of the Moon research is presented by her brother,
                        MacGregor, to the Royal Society, claiming that the Tree's flowers could revolutionize medicine
                        and aid the British war effort. The Houghtons request access to a recently acquired arrowhead
                        artifact. Lily believes it and an old Amazon map are the key to finding the Tree. The society
                        denies the request, believing the Tree is a myth and female scientists are inferior. Lily steals
                        the arrowhead, narrowly evading Prince Joachim, an ambitious German royal also seeking the Tree.
                        <br>
                        Arriving in Brazil, Lily and MacGregor need a boat and a guide to take them down the Amazon.
                        They hire skipper Frank Wolff, who offers cut-rate jungle cruises embellished with faked dangers
                        and corny puns. Frank initially declines, saying the trip is too dangerous, but he reconsiders
                        upon seeing the arrowhead. Frank steals back his repossessed boat engine, and the trio departs
                        after escaping Joachim, who pursues them in a U-boat.
                        <br>
                        In Frank's cabin, Lily notices photos and sketches of modern inventions, as well as maps,
                        drawings, and research on the Tears of the Moon. She accuses Frank of seeking the Tree, though
                        he insists he gave up long ago. Puka Michuna tribe, disguised as cannibals, captures the group
                        as one of Frank's faux dangers that he was unable to cancel in time. Lily is angry and doubts
                        Frank's honesty. The tribal chief translates the arrowhead's symbols, revealing the Tree's
                        location and that it only blooms under a blood moon.
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile, Joachim locates the conquistadors petrified inside a cave and frees them by diverting
                        the river, on the conditional offer to lift their curse if they retrieve the arrowhead for him;
                        the Spaniards attack the tribe and fatally stab Frank. Lily escapes with the arrowhead. As she
                        crosses the curse's boundary, vines capture the pursuing Spaniards, dragging them back into the
                        jungle.
                        <br>
                        To the Houghtons' shock, a fully revived Frank is found the next morning. Frank reveals he is
                        one of the cursed conquistadors who were once on a noble expedition to save Aguirre's gravely
                        ill daughter, but attacked the village. To defend the tribe, Frank trapped the other
                        conquistadors after years of fighting, away from the river where they turned to stone. He then
                        spent centuries unsuccessfully searching for the Tree, as the artifact was protected by the then
                        tribal chief's daughter; it would later be kept in London museum for Dr. Albert Falls.
                        <br>
                        Lily and Frank continue to La Luna Rota[c] Waterfall where they discover and raise a submerged
                        temple. Meanwhile, Joachim captures MacGregor, forcing him to reveal Lily's location. Frank,
                        Lily, MacGregor, the Germans, and the Spaniards all converge in the temple that houses the Tree.
                        It is discovered the arrowhead is actually a heart-shaped locket containing a gemstone. After
                        placing the gem and locket into the trunk, the dormant tree blooms under the blood moon. As a
                        fight ensues, Lily recovers one flower. The Germans drown, Joachim is crushed to death, and
                        Frank crashes his boat to block the river, petrifying him and the Spaniards. Lily, realizing her
                        true feelings for Frank, sacrifices the flower to lift his curse and restore his mortality.
                        Frank, who wanted to end his life, decides he will continue living to be with Lily. The moon's
                        last beam blooms a single flower, allowing Lily's research to proceed.
                        <br> 
                        Upon their successful return to England, Lily becomes a full professor at the University of
                        Cambridge and the Royal Society offers her full membership, which she rejects and guides Frank
                        in London.
