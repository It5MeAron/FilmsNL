                    <p>Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name the Rock, is an
                        American actor, producer, businessman, and former professional wrestler. Regarded as one
                        of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he wrestled for the World Wrestling
                        Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films
                        have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him
                        one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.
                        <br>
                        Johnson played college football at the University of Miami, and won a national championship in
                        1991. He aspired a professional career in football, but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft. He
                        signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the
                        team in his first season. Part of the Anoa'i family, Johnson's father Rocky and maternal
                        grandfather Peter Maivia were professional wrestlers, and he secured a contract with the WWF in
                        1996. He rose to prominence after developing the gimmick of a charismatic, boastful,
                        trash-talker and helped usher in the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and
                        early 2000s.
                        <br>
                        Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until
                        2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A 10-time world champion,
                        including the promotion's first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time
                        Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and
                        WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling
                        pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's
                        flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown).
                        <br>
                        Johnson's first leading role was as the titular character in the sword and sorcery film The
                        Scorpion King (2002), and has since starred in the comedies The Game Plan (2007), Tooth Fairy
                        (2010), and Central Intelligence (2016); the action-adventure films Journey 2: The Mysterious
                        Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), and Skyscraper (2018); the
                        science-fiction films San Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018), and the animated film Moana (2016).
                        His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), has helped
                        it become one of the highest-grossing film franchises. Johnson also stars in the Jumanji
                        films, appearing in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019),
                        and is set to portray Black Adam in its superhero film adaptation.
