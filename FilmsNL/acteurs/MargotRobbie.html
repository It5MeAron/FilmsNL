                    <p>Margot Elise Robbie (born 2 July 1990) is an Australian actress.
                        She has received several accolades throughout her career, including nominations for two Academy
                        Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, five British Academy Film Awards, and five Screen Actors
                        Guild Awards. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in
                        2017 and she was ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes in 2019.
                        <br>
                        Born and raised in Queensland, Robbie began her career in independent films and on the
                        television series Neighbours (2008–2011) and Pan Am (2011–2012). Her breakthrough came in 2013
                        with the black comedy film The Wolf of Wall Street. She went on to achieve wider recognition
                        with starring roles as Jane Porter in The Legend of Tarzan (2016) and Harley Quinn in the DC
                        Extended Universe media franchise, which includes the superhero films Suicide Squad (2016),
                        Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021).
                        <br>
                        Robbie garnered critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her
                        portrayal of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya (2017). This acclaim
                        continued with her roles as Queen Elizabeth I in the period drama Mary Queen of Scots (2018),
                        Sharon Tate in the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), and a fictional Fox News
                        employee in the drama Bombshell (2019); she received BAFTA Award nominations for all three and a
                        nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the last.
                        <br>
                        Robbie is married to British filmmaker Tom Ackerley. They are co-founders of the production
                        company LuckyChap Entertainment, under which they have produced several Academy Award-nominated
                        films, as well as the television series Dollface and Maid.
